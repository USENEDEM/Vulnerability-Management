# VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
---
### Project Overview
---
This vulnerability management project aims to provide a controlled environment for simulation of vulnerability management standard procedures including identification, prioritization, remediation and report of metasploitable 2 (ubuntu linux virtual machine) thereby providing insights on vulnerability analysis and management.

### Skills (*Learned*)
---
[*Bullet Points*]

1. Virtual box installation

2. Operating system installation on virtual box (kali linux)

3. Shell scripting

4. Familiarity with linux enviroment(kali linux)

5. Reconnaissance (information gathering) using whatweb.

6. Use of vulnerability management tool(tenable nessus) for scanning and detecting vulnerabilty in systems (vulnerability assessment).

7. Providing remediation using vulnerability management tool(tenable nessus)

8. Generating report using vulnerability management tool(tenable nessus)

### Tools

- Tenable Nessus - vulnerability management tool for vulnerability scans. [Download here](https://www.tenable.com)
- Oracle virtual box - For virtual Machine installation [Download here](https://www.virtualbox.org)
- Kali Linux - Open source operating system [Download here](https://www.kali.org)
- Metasploitable 2 - virtual vulnerable machine [Download here](https://www.vulhub.com)
- Whatweb - Used whatweb for reconnaissance *#sudo_apt_install_whatweb.*
- Nmap - Network and ip_scanner *#kali linux built in tool#*

## PROCEDURES:
---
### Set up a lab.


1. I downloaded and install oracle virtual box on macbook.
2. I downloaded and set up kali linux on oracle virtual box.
3. I downloaded and set up metasploitable 2 on the same network      interface as kali linux on oracle virtual box.
4. I downloaded and installed tenable nessus on kali linux.

### Reconnaissance.


5. Use the *#ifconfig* command on the *kali linux* terminal to find out your *ip address* on *eth0* , run *nmap* stealth scan with your *ip address* and *subnet range* e.g as follows:
```zsh
nmap -sS <ip address>
```
I ran an aggresive scan using whatweb by running the command: 
```zsh
whatweb <ip address> --aggression 3 -v --no-errors
```
with each of the *ip addresses* to identify metasploitable 2

### Vulnerability Assessment ( Identification and prioritization ).



6. Click on the new scan column at the top right corner of the screen, use the metasploitable 2 *ip address* to run a basic scan on tenable nessus.

7. The vulnerability assessment result will pop-up on the screen after scan completion including cvss(severity) score and remediation for each vulnerability.



### Below are the few Vulnerabilities i considered critical, with their severity scores and remediations:
___ 

1. Vulnerability (CVSS 10.0): The unix system running on the remote host is no longer supported and lack of support implies that no new security patches for the product will be released by the vendor as a result, it is likely to contain security vulnerabilities.
REMEDIATION: Upgrade to a new version of the unix operating system that is currently supported.

2. Vulnerability (CVSS 10.0): Atleast one of the NFS shares exported by the remote server could be mounted by scanning host. An attacker may be able leverage to read (possibly write) files on remote host .

REMEDIATION: Configure NFS and the remote host so that only authorised host can mount its remote shares.

3. Vulnerability (CVSS 09.82): The VNC server running on the remote host is secured with a weak password. Using VNC authentication and a password of 'password'. A remote unauthorised attacker could exploit this to take control of the system.
REMEDIATION: Secure the VNC Service with a strong password.

4. Vulnerability (CVSS 09.00): Apache tomcat AJP Connector request injection (ghostcat). A file read/indusion vulnerabilty was found in AJP connector. A remote, unauthorised attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read web application files from a vulnerable server. In instances where the vulnerable server allow file uploads, an attacker could upload malicious java server pages(JSP) code with a variety of file types and gain remote code execution(RCE).

REMEDIATION: Update the AJP configuration or require and upgrade the tomcat server to the latest version.
   

### Report
---

8. Report can be generated and downloded by clicking the top right column for report.
