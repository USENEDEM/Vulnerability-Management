# VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
---
### Project Overview
---
This vulnerability management project aims to provide a controlled environment for simulation of vulnerability management standard procedures including identification, prioritization, remediation and report of metasploitable 2 (ubuntu linux virtual machine) thereby providing insights on vulnerability analysis and management.

### Skills (*Learned*)
---
[*Bullet Points*]

1. Virtual box installation

2. Operating system installation on virtual box (kali linux)

3. Shell scripting

4. Familiarity with linux enviroment(kali linux)

5. Reconnaissance (information gathering) using whatweb.

6. Use of vulnerability management tool(tenable nessus) for scanning and detecting vulnerabilty in systems.

7. Providing remediation using vulnerability management tool(tenable nessus)

8. Generating report using vulnerability management tool(tenable nessus)

### Tools

- Tenable Nessus - vulnerability management tool for vulnerability scans. [Download here](https://www.tenable.com)
- Oracle virtual box - For virtual Machine installation [Download here](https://www.virtualbox.org)
- Kali Linux - Open source operating system [Download here](https://www.kali.org)
- Metasploitable 2 - virtual vulnerable machine [Download here](https://www.vulhub.com)
- Whatweb - Used whatweb for reconnaissance #sudo_apt_install_whatweb.

## PROCEDURES:
---
### Set up a lab.


1. Download and install oracle virtual box on macbook.
2. Download and set up kali linux on oracle virtual box.
3. Download and set up metasploitable 2 on the same network      interface as kali linux on oracle virtual box.
4. Download and install tenable nessus on kali linux.

### Reconnaissance.


5. Use the *#ifconfig* command on the *kali linux* terminal to find out your *ip address* on *eth0* , run *nmap* stealth scan with your *ip address* and *subnet range* e.g as follows:
```zsh
nmap -sS <192.168.43.1-255>
```
Run an aggresive scan using whatweb by running the command: 
```zsh
whatweb <ip address> --aggression 3 -v --no-errors
```
with each of the *ip addresses* to identify metasploitable 2

### Vulnerability Assessment ( Identification and prioritization ).



6. Click on the new scan column at the top right corner of the screen, use the metasploitable 2 *ip address* to run a basic scan on tenable nessus.


 

7. The vulnerability assessment result will pop-up on the screen after scan completion including cvss(severity) score and remediation for each vulnerability.

8. Report can be generated and downloded by clicking the top right column for report.
